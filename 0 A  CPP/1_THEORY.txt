==> #include adds a 'header file' to your code.
Header files contain various predefined functions that you can use in your code.
#include is a shortcut which includes all the important header files automatically to your code, so that you don't need to worry about adding any other header file.

==>"using namespace std" means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
Don't worry if you don't understand how #include and using namespace std works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.
==> A blank line. C++ ignores white space.
==> Another thing that always appears in a C++ program, is int main().
This is called a function.
Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
If there are multiple functions, this is the function which is executed first.
==> "cout" - We've already seen what this does.
==> "return 0 " ends the main function.
