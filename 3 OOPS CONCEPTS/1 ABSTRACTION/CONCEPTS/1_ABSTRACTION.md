⟫⇛ Data Abstraction:
⟫⇛ Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only
the essential details are displayed to the user. The
trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to
the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its
individual components. Data Abstraction may also be
defined as the process of identifying only the required
characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant
details.


⟫⇛ Abstraction  means providing only some of the information to the user by hiding its
internal implementation details. We just need to know about the methods of the objects
that we need to call and the input parameters needed to trigger a specific operation,
excluding the details of implementation and type of action performed to get the result


⟫⇛ Real-life example: When you send an email to someone, you just click send, and you get
the success message; what happens when you click send, how data is transmitted over
the network to the recipient is hidden from you (because it is irrelevant to you).

⟫⇛ The class helps us to group data
members and member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide
which data members will be visible to the outside world and not. Access specifiers are
the main pillar of implementing abstraction in C++. We can use access specifiers to
enforce restrictions on class members.

⟫⇛ Advantages Of Abstraction
● Only you can make changes to your data or function, and no one else can.
● It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the
background details.
● Increases the reusability of the code.
● Avoids duplication of your code.
