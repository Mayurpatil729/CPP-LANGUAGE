⟫⇛ Dynamic Binding:
⟫⇛ Dynamic binding refers to linking a procedure call to
code that will execute only once. The code
associated with the procedure is not known until the
program is executed, which is also known as late
binding. In dynamic binding, the code to be executed
in response to function call is decided at runtime.

⟫⇛ Message Passing:
⟫⇛ Objects communicate with one another by sending
and receiving information to each other. A message
for an object is a request for execution of a
procedure and therefore will invoke a function in
the receiving object that generates the desired
results. Message passing involves specifying the
name of the object, the name of the function and
the information to be sent.
