⟫⇛ Features of OOPs:-
 
● Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are
displayed to the user.
● Inheritance allows you to create class hierarchies, where a base class gives its
behavior and attributes to a derived class.
● Polymorphism ensures that it will execute the proper method based on the
calling object’s type.
● Encapsulation allows you to control access to your object’s state while making it
easier to maintain or change your implementation at a later date.
