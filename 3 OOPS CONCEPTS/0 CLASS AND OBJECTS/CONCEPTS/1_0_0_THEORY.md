# FATHER OF OOPS : Bjarne stroustrup.

⟫⇛ What is Object-Oriented Programming?
⟫⇛ Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer
programming model that organizes software design around
data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object
can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior

⟫⇛ Object-oriented programming — As the namesuggests uses objects in programming.
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world
entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc.
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and
the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access
this data except that function.

⟫⇛ Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming

1.Troubleshooting is easier with the OOP language
2.Code Reusability
3.Code Flexibility (Polymorphism)
4.Security (Data Abstraction)

⟫⇛ Applications of OOPs
1.Client-Server Systems
2.Real-Time System Design
3.Simulation and Modelling System
4.Office Automation Systems
5.A1 Expert Systems

Why do we need object-oriented programming?
❖ To make the development and maintenance of projects more effortless.
❖ To provide the feature of data hiding that is good for security concerns.
❖ We can solve real-world problems if we are using object-oriented programming.
❖ It ensures code reusability.
❖ It lets us write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so we
don't have to write basic stuff over and over again.

⟫⇛ What is a Class?
⟫⇛ It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data
members and member functions, which can be accessed and
used by creating an instance Of that class. """ A class is like a
blueprint for an object. """

### """ Collection of similar types of objects """.

A class contains variables(data members), methods, and constructors.
The data in a class is called a member, while functions in the class are called methods.

---

⟫⇛ What is an Object?
⟫⇛ An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour.

### """ An Object is an instance of a Class """. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

## "" Any real world entity which have some characteristics and behaviour ""

Object take up space in memory and have an associated address

⟫⇛ Data Members :- The variables which are declared in any class by using any
fundamental data types (like int, char, float, etc.) or derived data types (like class,
structure, pointer, etc.) are known as Data Members.

⟫⇛ Methods:- A method is the equivalent of a function in object-oriented programming
that is used inside classes. The methods are the actions that perform operations. A
method accepts parameters as arguments, manipulates these, and then produces an
output when the method is called on an object.

⟫⇛ Constructor:- Constructors are special class functions that perform the initialization of
every object. In C++, the constructor is automatically called when an object is created. It
is a special method of the class because it does not have any return type. It has the
same name as the class itself.

➔ Public: All the class members with a public modifier can be accessed from
anywhere (inside and outside the class)

➔ Private: All the class members with a private modifier can only be accessed by
the member function inside the class.

➔ Protected : The access level of a protected modifier is within the class and
outside the class through child class (or subclass). If you do not make the child
class, it cannot be accessed outside the class

➔ By default, in C++, all class members are private if you don't specify an access
specifier.
