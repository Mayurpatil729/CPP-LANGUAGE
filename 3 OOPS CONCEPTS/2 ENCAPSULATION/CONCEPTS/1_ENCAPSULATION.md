⟫⇛ Encapsulation:
⟫⇛ It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is
the mechanism that binds together code and the data it
manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a
protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by
the code outside this shield.


Encapsulation : 
Encapsulation refers to bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a
single unit. Many programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of
classes. A class is an example of encapsulation in computer science in that it consists of
data and methods that have been bundled into a single unit.


Adv : -> Data Hide --> security
if we want ,we can make class -- read only.
