⟫⇛ Polymorphism : exiting in multiple forms

Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented
Programming. Polymorphism is a concept that allows you to perform a single action in
different ways. Polymorphism is the combination of two Greek words. The poly means
many, and morphs means forms. So polymorphism means many forms. Let’s
understand polymorphism with a real-life example.


⟫⇛ Polymorphism:
⟫⇛ It refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate
between entities with the same name efficiently.
Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows
us to perform a single action in different ways.


Real-life example: A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a
man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person
possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.



Compile-time polymorphism is also known as static polymorphism. This type of
polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading or operator overloading.





a) Function overloading:
When there are multiple functions in a class with the same name but different
parameters, these functions are overloaded. The main advantage of function
overloading is that it increases the program’s readability. Functions can be overloaded
by using different numbers of arguments or by using different types of arguments. We
have already discussed function overloading in detail in the previous module.

b) Operator Overloading:
C++ also provides options to overload operators. For example, we can make the
operator (‘+’) for the string class to concatenate two strings. We know that this is the
addition operator whose task is to add two operands. When placed between integer
operands, a single operator, ‘+,’ adds them and concatenates them when placed
between string operands.

Points to remember while overloading an operator:
● It can be used only for user-defined operators(objects, structures) but cannot be
used for in-built operators(int, char, float, etc.).
● Operators = and & are already overloaded in C++ to avoid overloading them.
● The precedence and associativity of operators remain intact.
